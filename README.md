DOS - Denial Of Service attack is a type of attack that causes a complete or partial system outage. In this project we perform DOS attack using NS2 in the field of cyber security.

DOS attack is tracked using ns2-network simulator. It connects with the different networks and sends the data packets to the network. Traces the nam files. In the end of the project we learn to trace the network files and control the dos attack.
